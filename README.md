# Neo_Chen's Brainfuck Interpreter
## Doesn't even pass all of these tests
This is a simple interpreter, it don't have any fancy things like Byte Code,
dynamic memory allocation.

## Usage:
	brainfunk [-h] [-f file] [-c code] [-d]
* -d is for debugging, super verbose
* -f - is read from stdin
* -c is run code directly from the argument
